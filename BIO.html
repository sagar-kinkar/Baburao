    <p>I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on the
      interaction of algorithms and networks, and the roles they play in
      large-scale social and information systems. My work has been supported
      by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur
      Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons
      Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush
